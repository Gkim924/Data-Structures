On a overcast afternoon in the Pacific Northwest, Bill Gates wakes up with a raging headache from the previous nights Money Fight Club (where he invites other billionares over and they engage in combat with bag's full of cash). His smart house alerts him that he has to be at the yacht club in 45 mins to pay the deposit on Steve Jobs custom yacht, otherwise Elon Musk will buy it. Theres not enough time to go to the bank and make it to the club, so he must search his mansion as quickly as possible for $40 million. "There's probably enough cash laying around from last night", he thinks as he begins to consider where to start his search.
